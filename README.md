## Information
Do you want to give a piece of advice to a friend but you don't know where to start? Or are you tired of those bland horoscope and fortune-telling apps and wanted to spice things a bit? This JavaScript application is the perfect one for your program. It generates a sentence that can be as normal as a cookie on a table or as imaginative as flying xenomorphs in your bathroom.

## Technologies
This project is created in JavaScript ES6.

## Upcoming Updates
A dedicated website will be created for this application soon, as well as expansion of possible message content.

## Additional Notes
This is my output for the "Mixed Messages" project on Codecademy.
